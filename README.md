# Stretch Time

Due to COVID-19, the world switched Online and everyone is stuck in front of their computers. Our team felt that we all need to spare some time to stretch.

## Description
Our program leads user to follow the stretching postures and detects the user's postures. It shows them how they are doing through webcam, like a mirror. 
The timer starts countdown only when the user does the exact same pose with the given stretching pose.
